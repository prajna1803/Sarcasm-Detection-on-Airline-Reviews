I. Introduction Sarcasm detection is a challenging task in natural language processing (NLP), especially when dealing with user-generated content like reviews. This project aims to detect sarcasm in airline reviews using various deep learning and NLP techniques.

II. Dataset The dataset was taken from Data.world. Below is the link for the dataset. https://data.world/khushipitroda/skyratings-unleashing-23k-airline-reviews

The dataset consists of airline reviews.
It is labeled as sarcastic or non-sarcastic with the help of pre-trained model.
It includes the following features:
review: The text of the review.
sarcasm_label: Binary label indicating whether the review is sarcastic (1) or not (0).
Additional features related to airline information.

III. PREPROCESSING The preprocessing steps involved in this project include:
Data cleaning
Data prepocessing for sarcasm detection
